# webfont-preloading

This is a collection of demos showing different techniques to preload CSS webfonts and use it in your games. Here we are using [Phaser](http://phaser.io) as a game engine/framework.

You can see these demos [online here](https://mozdevs.github.io/webfont-preloading/).

# How to run the demos

You can also clone this repository and run them locally, but Phaser needs a server to be able to load assets. This means that just opening `index.html` will _not_ work. There are several quick ways to run a local server:

With Python:

```
python -m SimpleHttpServer
```

With npm and `http-server`:

```
npm install http-server -g
http-server
```
